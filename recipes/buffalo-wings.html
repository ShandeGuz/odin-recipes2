    <h1>Crispy Buffalo Wings</h1>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prep Chicken Wings</strong> Cut wings in half to separate the drums from the wingettes. Pat the wings dry with a paper towel. Preheat the oven and line a rimmed baking sheet with foil and place a wire rack over the pan.</li>
        <li><strong>Make dry seasoning</strong> Combine baking powder, salt, and garlic powder. </li>
        <li><strong>Season the wings</strong> Place the chicken wings in a large mixing bowl and toss them in the dry seasoning until well-coated. Assemble the wings in a single layer over the rack.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake</strong> in the center of the oven for 50 minutes, flipping halfway.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the Buffalo Sauce</strong> In a medium bowl, stir together melted butter, sugar, and hot sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Toss Wings in Sauce</strong> Transfer chicken wings to a bowl, and toss, drizzle with sauce and toss to coat. Serve with your favorite sauce.</li>
